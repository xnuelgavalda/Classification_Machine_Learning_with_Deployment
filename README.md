## General Information
Developed a classification model for predicting diabetes, achieving an accuracy of 90% by utilizing various machine learning algorithms and employing advanced techniques such as Hyperparameter Tuning, Ensemble methods, and K-fold Cross-Validation.

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adityadeshpande23/admissionpredictioncsv)

The goal of this project is to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using the following parameters:
- General test score (GRE).
- Test of English as a Foreign Language score (TOEFL).
- University rating.
- Statement of Purpose (SOP).
- Letter of Recommendation (LOR). 
- Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).

Key Features:
- Leveraged Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithms.
- Applied advanced techniques for model enhancement, including Hyperparameter Tuning, Ensemble methods, and K-fold Cross-Validation.

Files configuration:
- classificationModel.ipynb: Step-by-step models implementation.
- classificationModel_Pipeline.ipynb: Models implementation using scikit-learn pipeline.

## Outcomes and Impact
Successfully built a classification model that predicted diabetes with 90% accuracy, aiding in early identification and management of diabetes risk factors.

The project aimed to provide a robust tool for early diabetes risk assessment, enabling proactive measures for disease prevention and management.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement
Hyperparameter Tunning with GridSearchCV function and K-fold Cross Validation techniques are used to improve the performance.
But there are other techniques and algorithms that can be used.
